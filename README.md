This is an old personal website project I used to work on before I got comfortable with React and Next.js. It is built using just HTML, CSS, and experiments with Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS.


## About

- **Pages:**
	- **Home:** Introduction, bio, and latest updates.
	- **About:** My background, interests, and philosophy.
	- **Music:** A custom music player and playlist UI.
	- **Photos:** Responsive photo gallery with ocean and nature themes.
	- **Writings:** Poetry and essays, styled for readability.
	- **Videos:** Embedded YouTube video gallery, fully responsive.
	- **Blog:** Blog-style posts with images, hashtags, and custom meta info.
	- **Contact:** Simple contact form and social links.

- **Design:**
	- Glassmorphism (liquid glass) effect using Tailwind and custom CSS.
	- Responsive layouts for desktop and mobile.
	- Navigation bar with mobile menu toggle.
	- Consistent theme and color palette across all pages.

- **Tech & Learning:**
	- Pure HTML and CSS, with Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS for rapid prototyping.
	- No JavaScript frameworks—just a few vanilla JS scripts for interactivity (menus, date/time, music player).
	- Practiced accessibility, semantic HTML, and modern CSS features.
	- Learned about responsive design, flexbox, grid, and cross-browser compatibility.

## What I Learned

- How to structure a multi-page static website.
- How to use Tailwind CSS for fast, utility-first styling.
- How to create glassmorphism effects and modern UI components.
- How to embed and style media (audio, video, images) responsively.
- The importance of design consistency and user experience.

## Legacy

This project is a time capsule of my early web development journey. It helped me build the foundation for later work with React, Next.js, and more advanced web technologies. I still love the look and feel of glassy, clean UIs!

## Why This Exists

This project was my playground for learning and experimenting with web design before moving on to more advanced tools like React and Next.js. It’s a snapshot of my early web journey and my love for clean, glassy UI.
